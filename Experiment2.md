# EXPERIMENT 2 REPORT

This report lists the steps taken to prepare the experiment of my second study. See section 6 of the thesis for an extensive explanation of the method.

## Experimental items
In `Trans.hs`, I have added the option to translate all sentences from an input file in a source language to a target language, writing them to an output file. To use this option, do:

    stack run trans <source-language> <input-file> <target-language> <output-file>
